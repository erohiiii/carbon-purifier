    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>The <strong>Carbon Purifier Initiative</strong> is a forward-thinking environmental project engineered to combat the growing threat of air pollution, particularly from industrial exhaust. Our model presents an innovative, low-impact system designed to capture airborne carbon emissions before they are released into the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Utilizing a rotating belt mechanism with specially treated fabric, the purifier collects carbon particles from factory chimneys. These particles are then removed through a water-based self-cleaning system, allowing the cloth to be reused—minimizing waste and ensuring continuous operation. Built with accessible, affordable components, this solution is scalable and adaptable to real-world factory conditions. It is a testament to youth-led sustainability, blending science and purpose into one effective model.</p>

  <section id="mechanism">
    <h2>System Mechanism</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Emission:</strong> Factories release hot air and carbon particles through their chimneys.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration Layer:</strong> A carbon-capturing cloth is mounted on a conveyor system at the chimney outlet.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture Process:</strong> As the polluted air passes through, carbon particles adhere to the cloth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Cycle:</strong> The belt rotates continuously, moving used cloth toward a water tank.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Cleaning Phase:</strong> The cloth is washed, removing carbon residue and preparing it for reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbon Disposal:</strong> The extracted carbon can be processed, recycled, or disposed of safely.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="impact">
    <h2>Environmental Significance</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emission Reduction:</strong> Drastically decreases carbon pollution directly at the emission source.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusable Materials:</strong> Eco-conscious design reduces waste and encourages recycling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Built using widely available, inexpensive materials for scalability.</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness Building:</strong> Sparks discussions on pollution, climate change, and solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable Potential:</strong> Can evolve into a fully integrated industrial pollution control solution.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>This project is the brainchild of four innovative minds from <strong>Jayshree Periwal High School</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dhanya Sharma</li>
        <li>Dia Bhatia</li>
        <li>Raghavi Sonkiya</li>
        <li>Aarohi Agarwal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Guided by a shared commitment to sustainability and environmental awareness, our team brought together diverse perspectives and ideas to design a practical and meaningful model. We believe that youth have the power to inspire change, and this initiative is a step in that direction.</p>

  <section id="expansion">
    <h2>Future Vision</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>Our current model serves as a proof-of-concept, but the vision goes beyond demonstration. We aim to integrate advanced technologies that will elevate the efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability of the system across industrial environments.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensor Networks:</strong> Smart detection of pollutants for responsive cleaning cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Efficiency Filters:</strong> Adoption of next-gen materials like activated carbon fiber or nanotech membranes.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Emissions data tracking to monitor and regulate factory outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Automation:</strong> Seamless integration with factory software for intelligent operations.</li>
      </ul>
